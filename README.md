# Goal

Develop a data driven plan to help local officials decide on the type of housing to build in Arlington VA.

# Ideas

Here are some ideas we can develop to achieve our goal 


## Simulation Tool

Create a tool that can simulate housing growth by implementing certain strategies.  
We would want to optimize for jobs to housing ratio. The current worker to home ratio is 1.54 (that is one housing unit for every 1.54 jobs in the region)

Based on the result from the simulation, what changes can we make to best fit the simulation predictions?
